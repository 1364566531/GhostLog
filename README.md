Ghost Log
=========

Ghost Log is an Android application that displays the device logcat buffer in a system overlay window.

</a>

**NOTE: Device root (superuser) access is required to read system logs on Android 4.1 and above.**

Non-root users can still use Ghost Log with their own apps via intent integration - see below.

Features:

* Persistent logcat display as a system overlay
* Customisable log filters and display options
* Auto filter by the current foreground Activity process
* Quick access to pause/play, clear & share functions via rich notification
* Integration support for non-root devices


Non-root Integration
--------------------

Developers can use Ghost Log to display log messages generated by their own apps on non-rooted devices via a broadcast intent interface. This is currently in an experimental phase.

Integration will enable your app to receive messages from the Ghost Log app to start and stop a service inside your app which will monitor and broadcast all log output generated by your application processes back to Ghost Log for display.

**NOTE: You should enable this integration for debug builds only to avoid exposing log output to third parties in production.**

#### Gradle

If you are using the Gradle build system, simply add the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog:ghostlog-integration:+'
}
```

#### Ant/Eclipse

If you are using the old build system, download and place the integration library [JAR][1] inside your project `libs` folder and add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` (inside the `<application>` tag):

```xml
<!--Receives intents from Ghost Log app to start & stop the integration service-->
<receiver android:name="com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog.integration.IntegrationReceiver" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog.integration.COMMAND" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
<!--Reads logs and broadcasts them to Ghost Log-->
<service android:name="com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog.integration.IntegrationService" />
```
