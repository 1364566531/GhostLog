Ghost Log
=========

Ghost Log is an Android application that displays the device logcat buffer in a system overlay window.

**NOTE: Device root (superuser) access is required to read system logs on Android 4.1 and above**

Non-root users can still use Ghost Log with their own apps via intent integration - see below.

Features:

* Persistent logcat display as a system overlay
* Customisable log filters and display options
* Auto filter by the current foreground Activity process
* Quick access to pause/play, clear & share functions via rich notification
* Integration support for non-root devices


Non-root integration
--------------------

Developers can use Ghost Log to display log messages generated by their own apps on non-rooted devices via a broadcast intent interface.

Include the integration libary (JAR) in your project:


Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<!--Receives intents from Ghost Log app to start & stop the integration service-->
        <receiver android:name="com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog.integration.IntegrationReceiver" >
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog.integration.COMMAND" />
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>
        <!--Reads logs and broadcasts them to Ghost Log-->
        <service android:name="com.readystatesoftware.ghostlog.integration.IntegrationService" />
```

This will enable your app to recieve messages from the Ghost Log app to start and stop a service which will monitor and broadcast all log output generated by your application processes back to Ghost Log to display.

**NOTE: You should enable this integration for debug builds only so to avoid exposing log output to third parties in production (release) builds.**
